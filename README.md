# jordan-marinimicrobia

For this project, I'll be working with MAGs (metagenome-assembled genomes) from metagenomes. Specifically, I'll be using Marinimicrobia MAGs, which is an uncultured phylum of marine bacteria. I plan to do a pangenomic analysis of the phylum.

Types of data I have to work with:

Annotations: Kegg orthologs
Assembly: Fasta files of each contig and read, plus associated info (bam files, etc)
Bins: list of contigs and reads in each bin
CAT-BAT: information on the organism ID of each contig and read
